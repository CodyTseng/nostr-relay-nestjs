# Architecture Decisions

This document captures important architectural decisions made in the project along with their context and consequences.

## PM2 vs Docker for Deployment

### Context
- The application is a Nostr relay built with NestJS
- Primary functionality is handling WebSocket connections
- Deployment target is DigitalOcean droplets
- Need for efficient resource usage and cost-effectiveness

### Decision
We chose to use PM2 for process management instead of Docker containerization.

### Rationale
1. **Resource Efficiency**
   - PM2 runs Node.js applications natively with minimal overhead
   - Avoids the additional virtualization layer that Docker introduces
   - More efficient memory and CPU utilization

2. **Performance**
   - Direct access to host's network stack improves WebSocket performance
   - Lower latency for database connections
   - No container networking overhead

3. **Cost Benefits**
   - Can run effectively on smaller DigitalOcean droplets
   - Less resource overhead means more capacity for handling connections
   - Potential for significant hosting cost savings

4. **Operational Simplicity**
   - Built-in process management and monitoring
   - Simple log management with `pm2 logs`
   - Easy deployment and rollback capabilities
   - Real-time monitoring with `pm2 monit`

### Trade-offs
While Docker offers benefits like environment consistency and container isolation, these weren't critical for our use case. The performance and resource efficiency benefits of PM2 outweighed these advantages.

### Alternative Considerations
Docker would be more appropriate if we:
- Needed to run multiple different services
- Required strict service isolation
- Wanted guaranteed environment reproduction
- Planned for container orchestration or horizontal scaling

### Impact
- Smaller server footprint
- Better performance for WebSocket connections
- Simplified deployment process
- More direct access to system resources
- Easier monitoring and maintenance
